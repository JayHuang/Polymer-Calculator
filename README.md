#Polymer Calculator

A custom calculator element using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)

###Dependencies

Polymer - See the [official documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/getting-the-code.html) for Polymer

###Use

After including Polymer in your project, simply include `polymer-calculator.html`, `polymer-calculator.js`, and `polymer-calculator.css` from this repository.

Place the calculator in your page like this:
`<polymer-calculator></polymer-calculator>`

By default, the calculator uses the light theme. To use the dark theme instead, add `theme="dark"` as an attribute to the element
See `index.html` for examples

There is also support for calculations including brackets although buttons for brackets are not included. Try using keypresses!
